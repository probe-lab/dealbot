# Anonymous Retrieval Check

This document is the **source of truth** for how dealbot's Anonymous Retrieval check works.

Source code links throughout this document point to the current implementation.

For event and metric definitions to be used by the dashboard, see [Dealbot Events & Metrics](./events-and-metrics.md).

## Overview

The Anonymous Retrieval check (sometimes referred to internally as [retrieval++](https://github.com/FilOzone/dealbot/pull/427)) tests publicly discoverable pieces on a storage provider (pieces that were *not* uploaded by dealbot). The intent is to measure SP retrievability against real-world tenant data, not just dealbot's own corpus.

This is distinct from the [Retrieval check](./retrievals.md), which exercises pieces dealbot itself uploaded as part of a [Data Storage check](./data-storage.md). The Anonymous Retrieval check answers a different question: does the SP serve arbitrary pieces from its broader public corpus, with the same correctness and performance properties as dealbot's controlled pieces?

### Definition of Successful Retrieval

A successful anonymous retrieval requires:

1. **Piece fetch** — `GET {spBaseUrl}/piece/{pieceCid}` returns HTTP 2xx and the response bytes hash to the declared CommP (piece CID).

If the piece advertises IPFS indexing (`withIPFSIndexing = true` and a non-null `ipfsRootCid`), three additional dimensions are validated *independently*. Importantly, they do not gate the overall `piece_fetch_status`, and each is recorded as its own outcome column / metric:

2. **CAR parseable:** the fetched bytes parse as a CAR file.
3. **IPNI:** the SP is advertised as a provider for the root CID and a sample of child CIDs via filecoinpin.contact.
4. **Block fetch:** a sample of CIDs from the parsed CAR is re-fetched via `{spBaseUrl}/ipfs/{cid}?format=raw` and each response is hash-verified against its declared CID.

A piece without IPFS indexing is exercised only at step (1).

Operational timeouts exist to prevent jobs from running indefinitely. If the job exceeds `ANON_RETRIEVAL_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, it is aborted; a row is still emitted so that partial metrics (TTFB, bytes, response code) are not lost.

## Piece Selection

Unlike the [Retrieval check](./retrievals.md#piece-selection), dealbot does not retrieve from its own deals. Pieces are sampled from the [on-chain subgraph](../../src/subgraph) of all FWSS-served pieces for the SP under test.

Selection strategy (per scheduled job, per SP):

1. **Pick a size bucket** by weighted random:
   - `small` (1–10 MiB) — 20%
   - `medium` (10–50 MiB) — 50%
   - `large` (50–100 MiB) — 30%
2. **Pick a pool**:
   - `indexed` (IPFS-indexed pieces) — 80%
   - `any` (all FWSS pieces) — 20%
3. **Generate a uniform-random `sampleKey`** and query the subgraph for the smallest `Root.sampleKey ≥ $sampleKey` matching the SP, payer, size range, and pool filters. If no such row exists (the random key fell above every matching `sampleKey`), `sampleAnonPiece` retries in the reverse direction (largest `sampleKey < $sampleKey`) so the highest keys are not a dead zone.
4. **Fall back** through: (same bucket, opposite pool) → (any bucket, indexed) → (any bucket, any).

The 80/20 split for `indexed` vs `any` exists so that SPs cannot optimize only their CAR corpus and still appear healthy on this check.

> [!NOTE]
> The bucket sizes were chosen such that the whole file will still fit into memory. In the future we may implement a streaming verification and parsing.

## What Happens Each Cycle

flowchart TD
  Select["Sample anonymous piece for SP from subgraph"] --> Fetch["GET /piece/{pieceCid}"]
  Fetch --> CommP["Hash bytes → verify CommP"]
  CommP --> HasIpfs{"piece.withIPFSIndexing<br/>and ipfsRootCid?"}
  HasIpfs -- "no" --> Record["Persist ClickHouse row + emit Prometheus metrics"]
  HasIpfs -- "yes" --> ParseCar["Parse bytes as CAR"]
  ParseCar --> SampleBlocks["Pick N random CIDs<br/>(ANON_RETRIEVAL_BLOCK_SAMPLE_COUNT)"]
  SampleBlocks --> Ipni["IPNI: verify SP advertises root + sampled CIDs"]
  SampleBlocks --> BlockFetch["GET /ipfs/{cid}?format=raw for each sampled CID"]
  BlockFetch --> HashCheck["Hash-verify each response against its CID"]
  Ipni --> Record
  HashCheck --> Record
```

### Piece Fetch

- **URL:** `{spBaseUrl}/piece/{pieceCid}` (HTTP/2)
- **Buffered in memory** — piece sizes are capped at 100 MiB by selection (the upper bound of the `large` bucket).
- **Validates CommP** — the CommP of the response bytes must match `pieceCid`.

Source: [`piece-retrieval.service.ts`](../../apps/backend/src/retrieval-anon/piece-retrieval.service.ts)

### CAR / IPNI / block-fetch validation (only when piece advertises IPFS indexing)

When the selected piece has `withIPFSIndexing = true` and a non-null `ipfsRootCid`, three dimensions are exercised by `PieceValidationService`. Each dimension has an independent outcome; a failure or skip in one never bleeds into another's status.

1. **CAR parse:** `@ipld/car` parses the response bytes; a random sample of `ANON_RETRIEVAL_BLOCK_SAMPLE_COUNT` CIDs is selected for the next two steps.
2. **IPNI check:** `IpniVerificationService.verify(rootCid, sampledCids, sp)` polls filecoinpin.contact until each CID resolves to the SP under test, the timeout fires, or `IPNI_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT_MS` is reached.
3. **Block fetch check:** for each sampled CID, fetch `{spBaseUrl}/ipfs/{cid}?format=raw` and hash-verify the response against the CID. Non-2xx, hash mismatch, unsupported codec, or transport errors all count as a single failed block.

CAR parse failure (`not_parseable`) is attributed to the client (bad upload), not the SP. When the CAR is unparseable, IPNI and block fetch are skipped because there are no sampleable CIDs to verify or fetch.

## What Gets Asserted

| # | Assertion | How It's Checked | Retries | Relevant Metric |
|---|-----------|------------------|:---:|------------------|
| 1 | SP serves the piece | `GET /piece/{pieceCid}` returns HTTP 2xx | 0 | [`anonPieceRetrievalLastByteMs`](./events-and-metrics.md#anonPieceRetrievalLastByteMs) |
| 2 | Bytes match the declared CommP | Hash of response bytes equals `pieceCid` | 0 | [`anonPieceRetrievalStatus`](./events-and-metrics.md#anonPieceRetrievalStatus) |
| 3 | Bytes parse as a CAR (IPFS-indexed pieces only) | `@ipld/car` parses the response | 0 | [`anonCarParseStatus`](./events-and-metrics.md#anonCarParseStatus) |
| 4 | SP is advertised on IPNI for root + sampled CIDs | filecoinpin.contact returns provider records | polling until timeout | [`anonIpniStatus`](./events-and-metrics.md#anonIpniStatus) |
| 5 | Sampled blocks fetch + hash-verify | `/ipfs/{cid}?format=raw` for each sample | 0 | [`anonBlockFetchStatus`](./events-and-metrics.md#anonBlockFetchStatus) |

## Sub-status meanings

Unlike the [Data Storage check](./data-storage.md#deal-status-progression), anonymous retrieval does **not** have a rolled-up status (e.g., `anonRetrievalStatus`). Piece retrieval, CAR parsing, IPNI verification, block-fetch outcomes are recorded independently. Each status metric below is emitted exactly once per check, except when `anonPieceRetrievalStatus=skipped` because selection itself failed and no HTTP/CAR/IPNI/block-fetch work ran.

| anonPieceRetrievalStatus | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `success` | `GET /piece/{pieceCid}` returned HTTP 2xx **and** the response bytes hashed to the declared CommP. |
| `skipped` | The subgraph returned no candidate piece for the SP after all selection fallbacks. No HTTP request was attempted. |
| `failure.http` | Piece fetch did not return HTTP 2xx, or the request failed at the transport layer (DNS, TLS, connection reset, etc.). |
| `failure.commp` | Piece fetch returned HTTP 2xx, but the response bytes hashed to a different CID than `pieceCid`. The bytes are discarded — downstream CAR / IPNI / block-fetch validation is skipped to avoid amplifying a misbehaving SP. |
| `failure.timedout` | The job-level `AbortSignal` fired (most often `ANON_RETRIEVAL_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`). Partial timing/byte evidence is still persisted. |
| `failure.other` | Catch-all for retrieval failures that do not match any of the categories above. |

| anonCarParseStatus | Meaning                                                                                                                                               |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `parseable` | The fetched piece bytes were successfully parsed as a CAR by `@ipld/car`.                                                                             |
| `not_parseable` | The fetched piece bytes could not be parsed as a CAR (malformed header, truncated content, unexpected encoding, or parser threw an error). |
| `skipped` | CAR parsing was not attempted — piece fetch failed, the piece does not advertise IPFS indexing, or the job aborted before parsing.                    |

| anonIpniStatus | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `valid` | filecoinpin.contact returned the SP as a provider for the root CID **and** every sampled child CID within `IPNI_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT_MS`. |
| `invalid` | IPNI was queried but at least one CID never resolved to the SP under test before the timeout (or the timeout fired with unresolved CIDs). |
| `skipped` | IPNI verification was not attempted — piece fetch failed, the piece does not advertise IPFS indexing, CAR parsing returned `not_parseable`, the root CID itself failed to parse, or the job aborted. |
| `error` | IPNI verification was attempted and `IpniVerificationService.verify` threw unexpectedly (transport error, service down, etc.). |

| anonBlockFetchStatus | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `success` | Every sampled CID was fetched via `GET {spBaseUrl}/ipfs/{cid}?format=raw` and the response bytes hash-verified against the declared CID. |
| `failure` | At least one sampled block fetch failed: non-2xx HTTP, hash mismatch, unsupported codec, unsupported hash, or transport error. Each failed sample counts as one failed block. |
| `skipped` | Block-fetch sampling was not attempted — piece fetch failed, the piece does not advertise IPFS indexing, CAR parsing returned `not_parseable`, or the job aborted. |
| `error` | Block-fetch sampling was attempted but the loop threw unexpectedly outside the per-block try/catch. |

## Result Recording

Each anonymous retrieval attempt writes one row to the `anon_retrieval_checks` ClickHouse table unless we could not find a piece to probe for the SP. The row is emitted **even on abort or unexpected error** so that the partial evidence (TTFB, bytes, response code) is preserved.

The DDL and column-level comments in [`clickhouse.schema.ts`](../../apps/backend/src/clickhouse/clickhouse.schema.ts) are authoritative. The summary below is for orientation.

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `timestamp` | When the check started (ms UTC) |
| `probe_location` | Dealbot probe location (`DEALBOT_PROBE_LOCATION`) |
| `sp_address`, `sp_id`, `sp_name` | SP identity |
| `retrieval_id` | Per-event UUID; correlates row to logs and Prometheus |
| `piece_cid`, `data_set_id`, `piece_id`, `raw_size` | Sampled piece identity |
| `with_ipfs_indexing`, `ipfs_root_cid` | Whether the piece advertises IPNI metadata |
| `service_type` | Always `direct_sp` today |
| `retrieval_endpoint` | URL probed for piece fetch |
| `piece_fetch_status` | `success` or `failed` — outcome of `/piece/{cid}` (HTTP 2xx **and** CommP match). CAR/IPNI/block-fetch outcomes live in their own columns and do **not** flip this status. |
| `http_response_code` | Raw HTTP status; null on transport failure |
| `first_byte_ms`, `last_byte_ms`, `bytes_retrieved`, `throughput_bps` | Piece-fetch performance |
| `commp_valid` | Null when retrieval failed before CommP could be hashed |
| `car_status` | `parseable` \| `not_parseable` \| `skipped` — mirrors `anonCarParseStatus` |
| `car_block_count` | Total CAR block count; null unless `car_status='parseable'` |
| `block_fetch_endpoint` | Gateway base URL probed; null when skipped or SP info missing |
| `block_fetch_status` | `success` \| `failure` \| `skipped` \| `error` — mirrors `anonBlockFetchStatus` |
| `block_fetch_sampled_count`, `block_fetch_failed_count` | Sampled / failed block counts; null when skipped |
| `ipni_status` | `valid` \| `invalid` \| `skipped` \| `error` — mirrors `anonIpniStatus` |
| `ipni_verify_ms` | IPNI verification duration; null when skipped |
| `error_message` | Failure reason; null on success |
